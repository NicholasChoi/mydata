- enabling key repeats on a Mac
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled 0

- disabling mouse acceleration on a Mac
defaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.scaling -1
defaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.trackpad.scaling -1
defaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.scrollwheel.scaling 0.1
(Run the above in Terminal.app, log out, and then back in. If it didn't work something else has probably touched the file. That's unlikely to happen shortly after a clean login, so just do it again. If you succeed, don't be afraid to change mouse settings in System Preferences. It'll be left at -1 as long as you don't touch the speed slider.)
